# Chapter 2 - Cubersecurity Threat Landscape

## 2-1. Classifying cybersecurity Threats:

Cybersecurity threat actors types:
1. Internal vs. External
	* Behavioral assessments are a powerful tool in identifying insider attacks
3. Level of Sophistication/ Capability
 
4. Resources/Funcding
5. Intent/ Motivation
	* Nation-states
	* 
	* Organized crime; money


Hackers:
1. Whatie hat
2. Gray hat
3. black hat

Threat actors:
1. Script kiddie => basic security desin
2. Hacktivist
3. Criminal Syndicate: In their 2019 Internet Organized Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) found that organized crime groups were active in a variety of cybercrime categories, including the following:
	* Cyber-dependent crime: ransomware; DDoS
	* Child sexual exploitation
	* Payment fraud
	* Dark web activity
	* Terrorism support
	* Cross-cutting crime factors
	
5. APT: advanced persistent threat

6. Zero-Day Attacks
7. Insider: Behavioral assessments are a powerful tool in identifying insider attacks => workd with HR department
8. The Threat of Shadow IT
9. Competitors; Corporate espinage

## 2-2-Threar Vectors
Threat vectors  are the means that threat actors use to obtain that access.
1. Email and Social media; Phishing, spam 
2. Direct Access
3. Wireless Networks
4. Removable Media
5. Cloud
6. Third-Party Risks; IT supply chain

## 2-3-Threat Data and Intelligence

**Threat intelligence** is the set of activities and resources available to cybersecurity professionals seeking to learn about changes in the threat environment.
* Predictive analysis to identify likely risks
***Threat intelligence Sources:***
1. OSINT: Open source intelligence
2. Threat feed dat: technical details, IP add, sostname and domain, email address, URLs, file hashes, file path, CVE numbers,...
3. Vulnerability databases
4. IoCs: Indicators of COmpromise

### OSP:
1. Senki.org
2. AT&T : The Open Threat Exchange 
3. MISP: Threat Sharin gProtject
4. Threatfeeds.io
Government and public  sources:
5. CISA: Cubersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
Vender websites:
6. Microsoft's therat intelligence blog
7. Cisco's threat security site
Public sources
8. SANS Internet Storm Center
9. VirusShare
10. Spamhaus
11. DArk web market place

**Dark Web:** The dark web  is a network run over standard Internet connections but using multiple layers of encryption to provide anonymous communication. Hackers often use sites on the dark web to share information and sell credentials and other data stolen during their attacks

### Proprietary and Closed-Source Intelligence

1. Threat maps: Proprietary and Closed-Source Intelligence; fireeye

Assessing Threat Intelligence(confidence Score)
1. Timely
2. Accuracy 
3. Relevance 

### Assessing the Confidence Level of YOur Intelligence:
1. Confire=med(90-100)
2. Probable(70-89)
3. Possible(50-69)
4. Doubtful(30-49)
5. Improbable (2-29)
6. Discredited(1)

## Threat Indicator Management and Exchange
Structured markup languages: STIX , OpenIOC
1. Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)' XML language(2 models: relatiobship, sighting)
2. STIX: 
3. TAXII: Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information protocol ( at the application layer via HTTPS)support STIX data exchange.
4. open Indicators of Compromise; XML-based framework

### Public and Private Information Sharing Centers
1. Information sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) helps share therat info

## Conduct Your Own Research:
1. Vendor security information websites
2. V
3. RFC: Request for Comment
4. Conferences 
5. Social media
